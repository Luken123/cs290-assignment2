        This week looks at HTML and CSS. These are the only tools a web developer has at their disposal to define what data will be shown on a page, give it meaning and determine its visual layout. There are a lot of ways to use and misuse these tools. As you learn this material, there will be a major focus on conforming to standards. As you become more accomplished, you will learn when you can deviate from the standards, but for now, everything should conform to the W3 standards and you should strive to understand things in the context of that standard. Note, there is no quiz this week, they will occur in weeks in which there are no assignments due.
